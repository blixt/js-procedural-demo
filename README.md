===============

A procedurally generated universe.

Uses [procedural](https://github.com/blixt/js-procedural) for generating the
whole universe.


WIP

This project is a work in progress. The goal is to render individual planets
with vegetation.


How to run it
-------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blixt/js-procedural-demo.git
cd js-procedural-demo
npm install
gulp
```

If you don't have the `gulp` command line tool, you need to install the package
globally: `npm install -g gulp`. You can read more about gulp and how it works
on [its website](http://gulpjs.com/).
